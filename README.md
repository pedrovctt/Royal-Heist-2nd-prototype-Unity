# Royal Heist 2.0 (Unity Prototype)

This is the second prototype of **Royal Heist**, now rebuilt from scratch using **Unity**.  
The goal of this version is to improve the visuals, control, and overall experience compared to the first Java version.  
At the moment, you can still explore one of the upper floors, controlling the main character Vance (Thief). Character names may be placeholders for now and will be finalized in future updates.

Moving to Unity allows me to:
- Have smoother movement and better physics.
- Easily create more complex environments and animations.
- Prepare the game for future upgrades like enemy AI, items, and more interactive elements.

## Tech info
- **Engine**: Unity
- **Language**: C#  
- **IDE Used**: VS Code and Unity Editor  

## Notes
This is still an early prototype. Expect placeholder graphics, temporary controls, and rough edges :D  
The focus here is on learning, experimenting, and laying a solid foundation for the full game.
