# Royal-Heist-2nd-prototype-Unity
Royal Heist is still in its early prototype stage. This version has been a bit rebuilt in Unity, aiming for smoother movement, better visuals, and easier expansion. It's a 2D-Pixel-Art game with basic character movement. You can control Vance, the thief, using keyboard controls.
